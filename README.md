# Patch-Clamp-Analysis
This project exists to omit installation oh Clampfit with useless drivers and programs that you are not able to set up separately
This project is still updating. 
Nowadays, my code works for a Voltage clamp to analyse the currents of ion channels: current-voltage curves, signals, Calculation of the cell's capacitance currents, etc.
